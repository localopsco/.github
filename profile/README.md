LocalOps is a central cloud native deployment platform that enables developers to offer SaaS, BYOC (Bring your own cloud), On-Prem, Self-hosted versions of their services in minutes.

No need to write Dockerfiles, Kubernetes helm charts, Terraform scripts, Pulumi scripts or hire DevOps engineers.

1. Connect cloud account
2. Connect Github repo
3. Push commits to deploy

## Top deployment modes

1. SaaS: Deploy services in own cloud account for all users to use.
2. Single tenant SaaS: Offer dedicated cluster and infrastructure for specific privacy/performance-demanding customers.
